# GGJ 2024

Repo for Global Game Jam 2024 (will be renamed, hopefully)

The theme is "Make Me Laugh".

The working title of the game is *A chicken crosses the road and walks into a bar*.

This is basically like Frogger but with a chicken trying to cross the road instead of a frog. After you cross the road you walk into the bar and your vision gets progressively more impaired as you proceed to cross the road to the next bar.

This game is written in a custom programming language that was created for this jam called **ROFLang**.

I'm still figuring out what this will look like.
